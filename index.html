            <h2>European and Mediterranean Influence</h2>
            <p>The resort's theme is inspired by Walt Disney's experiences in Europe. You will find many photos from his travels adorning the walls. The featured rooftop restaurant, Topolino's Terrace, provides seated dining and a character meet & greet. For a quick snack or a coffee, the main lobby houses Le Petite Caf√©, named after the angry chef's restaurant in The Aristocats.</p>
            <h2>Disney Skyliner Access</h2>
            <p>Located at the resort is access to The Disney Skyliner. This gondola lift system provides quick and easy access to EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and several other Disney World Resorts.</p>
            <h2>The Latest Disney Vacation Club Resort</h2>
            <p>Opening in December 2019, Disney's Riviera Resort is the latest Disney Vacation Club property to be built, and 15th overall. The Disney Vacation Club is a timeshare program where you obtain real estate interest in a property by purchasing set amount of points for a single lump-sum payment. The points are renewed annually for the length of your contract which will vary depending on which property you buy into. All Riviera contracts, for example, end in 2070.</p>
